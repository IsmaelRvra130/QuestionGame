// ### Instructions

// * Starting from a blank HTML file, create an array with 10 question objects. Each object in the array should be structured as follows: 

//   `{ q: "QUESTION", a: "ANSWER" }`
var gameQuestions = [
    {q: "Who was the first president of the United States of America?", a: "George Washington"},
    {q: "Who created Tesla, the self driving car?", a: "Elon Musk"},
    
    
]

// * Then create code that will ask the user questions, one by one. The user must answer by hitting t (for true) or f (for false).

// * Check the user's answer against the correct answer, and provide them with an alert telling them if they are right or wrong.

// * Keep track of the user's score.

// * Don't worry about having DRY code to start with. Just focus on getting working code first.
